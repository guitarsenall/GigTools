OBJECTIVES:
    Refresh Python skills by creating some tools to help process my
    gig data.
        * Bigger goals:
            Prioritize songs for rehearsals
            Prioritize songs for repeat gigs
                (e.g., don't play what I played last month)
            Notify me when a guitar needs new strings
        * Baby steps:
            Script to reverse the song list since it comes
                backwards from OneNote
            Match mis-spelled song titles
                Idea: matching 2-character sequences exceeding
                a percentage threshold.
            Get gig data from Outlook and/or OneNote

+   Get python working again.

    *   Update PyScripter
        -   The update  REQUIRES that I install Python 3.7 or above.
            It is also 32-bit. After some researching, I think I want
            to go with 64-bit (default download).
        -   Download 64-bit PyScripter
                https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/
                PyScripter-4.3.4-x64-Setup.exe
            Don't install yet. First install Python.
        -   Download latest 64-bit version of Python from
                https://www.python.org/downloads/
                python-3.12.3-amd64.exe
            Install. Default.
            Verify at command prompt:
                >py
            Gives:
                Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45)
                [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
            That is an old version installed before.
            Where is it installed? Google. Here:
                C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\
            Verify in command window:
                C:\Users\Owner>cd C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs
                        \Python\Python312
                C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312>python
                Python 3.12.3 (tags/v3.12.3:f6650f9, Apr  9 2024, 14:05:25)
                    [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
                Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
                    information.
            Looks good.
        -   Now install
                PyScripter-4.3.4-x64-Setup.exe
            It found Python 3.12.3 and runs with it automatically.

    *   Simple task: reverse and print a list of songs.
        -   scratch.py
            >   This works:
                    songs.reverse()
                    print(*songs, sep='\n')
                So does
                    print('\n'.join(songs))
        -   Can I get it to read from a file?
            It works!
            >   How can I make this callable from command prompt
                :   Take clues from
                        S:\will\documents\OneDrive\2018\fitfiles
                            \fitfileanalyses.bat
                    The command line is
                        c:\python27\python %base%\fitfileanalyses.py %1
                    where %base% is the folder containing fitfileanalyses.py
                    and %1 is the data file. So the command should look
                    something like
                        <path>python <path>reverse_song_list.py songlist.txt
                :   Get more clues from
                        S:\will\documents\OneDrive\2018\fitfiles
                            \fitfileanalyses.py
                    about getting command-line arguments.
                    And more from
                        https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
                            /python_command_line_arguments.htm
                :   Problem: the 'python' command points to v2.7.
                    But I don't want to change this.
                    This works:
                        ...>py reverse_songlist.py songlist.txt
                    because 'py' brings v3.6.
                        https://docs.python.org/3/using
                            /windows.html#configuring-python
                    Why doesn't 3.12 come up?
                    Can't I just create a windows command (like python312)
                    that refers to the one I want?
                        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5181709
                            /custom-commands-in-windows-command-prompt
                    suggest a batch file is the best option. Try it.
                    Got this working:
                        S:\...\gigtools>reverse_songlist songlist.txt
                    which calls reverse_songlist.py on the file songlist.txt.
                :   Make an EditPlus tool I can call from the song-list file:
                        reverse_songlist_editplus_a.png
                    it works!!! It even captures the output in the output
                    window so I don't need to hold a command window open.

    *   Time to get this project under version control with GIT. Follow
                S:\will\documents\OneDrive\2018\fitfiles\data
                    \analysis_notes.txt
        for techniques.
        -   Right-click in the main folder and select "about". Update
            TortoiseGit from 2.7.0.0 to 2.16.0.0.
            >   It has trouble shutting down other applications then complains
                about some .cab file being corrupt. Reboot. TortoiseGit
                is gone from the context menu. Go to
                    https://tortoisegit.org/
                    TortoiseGit-2.16.0.0-64bit.msi
            >   Do I need to update Git? Will it tell me?
                Yes, my version is old and unsupported. It prompts me to
                open the git website.
                    https://gitforwindows.org/
                    Git-2.45.0-64-bit.exe
                Cancel the TortoiseGit installation and install Git 2.45.
                Use defaults.
                    Removing Git 2.22
                Odd, I thought 2.22 was what TortoiseGit wanted.
            >   Install TortoiseGit 2.16.0
                It asks if I want to modify, repair, or remove. Try repair.
                It appears to work now.
        -   Right-click in the main folder and select "create GIT repository
            here."
        -   Create the new repository on GitHub. No license, public, no readme,
            no .gitignore
                    https://github.com/guitarsenall/GigTools.git
        -   Link the two together.
            >   I will need README.md. Clone one from
                    S:\will\documents\OneDrive\2018\notesparser
                        \notesparser\README.md
            >   Add the files I have, including README.md.

    *   Song database
        -   in SQL?
