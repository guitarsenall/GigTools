OBJECTIVES:
    Refresh Python skills by creating some tools to help process my
    gig data.
        * Bigger goals:
            Prioritize songs for rehearsals
            Prioritize songs for repeat gigs
                (e.g., don't play what I played last month)
            Notify me when a guitar needs new strings
        * Baby steps:
            Script to reverse the song list since it comes
                backwards from OneNote
            Match mis-spelled song titles
                Idea: matching 2-character sequences exceeding
                a percentage threshold.
            Get gig data from Outlook and/or OneNote

+   Get python working again.

    *   Update PyScripter
        -   The update  REQUIRES that I install Python 3.7 or above.
            It is also 32-bit. After some researching, I think I want
            to go with 64-bit (default download).
        -   Download 64-bit PyScripter
                https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/
                PyScripter-4.3.4-x64-Setup.exe
            Don't install yet. First install Python.
        -   Download latest 64-bit version of Python from
                https://www.python.org/downloads/
                python-3.12.3-amd64.exe
            Install. Default.
            Verify at command prompt:
                >py
            Gives:
                Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45)
                [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
            That is an old version installed before.
            Where is it installed? Google. Here:
                C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\
            Verify in command window:
                C:\Users\Owner>cd C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs
                        \Python\Python312
                C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312>python
                Python 3.12.3 (tags/v3.12.3:f6650f9, Apr  9 2024, 14:05:25)
                    [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
                Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
                    information.
            Looks good.
        -   Now install
                PyScripter-4.3.4-x64-Setup.exe
            It found Python 3.12.3 and runs with it automatically.

    *   Simple task: reverse and print a list of songs.
        -   scratch.py
            >   This works:
                    songs.reverse()
                    print(*songs, sep='\n')
                So does
                    print('\n'.join(songs))
        -   Can I get it to read from a file?
            It works!
            >   How can I make this callable from command prompt
                :   Take clues from
                        S:\will\documents\OneDrive\2018\fitfiles
                            \fitfileanalyses.bat
                    The command line is
                        c:\python27\python %base%\fitfileanalyses.py %1
                    where %base% is the folder containing fitfileanalyses.py
                    and %1 is the data file. So the command should look
                    something like
                        <path>python <path>reverse_song_list.py songlist.txt

                    about getting command-line arguments.

                            /python_command_line_arguments.htm
                :   Problem: the 'python' command points to v2.7.
                    But I don't want to change this.
                    This works:
                        ...>py reverse_songlist.py songlist.txt
                    because 'py' brings v3.6.

                    Why doesn't 3.12 come up?
                    Can't I just create a windows command (like python312)
                    that refers to the one I want?

                    Got this working:
                        S:\...\gigtools>reverse_songlist songlist.txt
                    which calls reverse_songlist.py on the file songlist.txt.
                :   Make an EditPlus tool I can call from the song-list file:
                        reverse_songlist_editplus_a.png
                    it works!!! It even captures the output in the output
                    window so I don't need to hold a command window open.

    *   Time to get this project under version control with GIT. Follow

        -   Right-click in the main folder and select "about". Update
            TortoiseGit from 2.7.0.0 to 2.16.0.0.
            >   It has trouble shutting down other applications then complains

                    https://tortoisegit.org/
                    TortoiseGit-2.16.0.0-64bit.msi
            >   Do I need to update Git? Will it tell me?
                Yes, my version is old and unsupported. It prompts me to
                open the git website.
                    https://gitforwindows.org/
                    Git-2.45.0-64-bit.exe
                Cancel the TortoiseGit installation and install Git 2.45.
                Use defaults.
                    Removing Git 2.22
                Odd, I thought 2.22 was what TortoiseGit wanted.
            >   Install TortoiseGit 2.16.0
                It asks if I want to modify, repair, or remove. Try repair.
                It appears to work now.
        -   Right-click in the main folder and select "create GIT repository
            here."
        -   Create the new repository on GitHub. No license, public, no readme,
            no .gitignore
                The site is at
                    https://github.com/guitarsenall/GigTools
                The repository URL is
                    https://github.com/guitarsenall/GigTools.git
        -   Link the two together.

                    tortoise_git_push_a.png
                This is a little different. With FitFiles, I used the
                Arbitrary URL field, but remote seems more appropriate.
                    Authentication failed
                I think Git forgot about my password. Settings dialog.
                Can't find where to enter it. Google. Nothing.
                Try push again. It prompted me for username and password
                but failed again.
                Try push again. It launched a dialog that let me authenticate
                through the browser, and IT WORKED!! And the files are on
                GitHub.
                Weird.

    *   Another simple task: compare strings for partial match.
        OneNote OCR often misspells song titles that I have to fix manually.
        If I have a reference of correct titles, perhaps I can detect which
        song a misspelling refers to, correct it, and detect the match.
        -   A basis for detecting a partial match:
                https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-str-compare/
        -   Define the correct titles.
            >   Let's start by doing this right: Export The Repertwaar to
                        music_performance_repertoire.csv
                :   I will need to strip the '*' for instrumental titles.
                    Or leave it in since I only need a partial match?
                :   How do I read a CSV file in python?
                    Python comes with a CSV library:
                        https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
                    May as well start there.
                    A tutorial is at
                        https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08
                            /python-tutorial-working-with-csv-file
                            -for-data-science/
                :   Error: some fields have quotes that give it problems.
                    Found this:
                        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21527057
                            /python-parse-csv-ignoring-comma-with-double-quotes
                    which uses,
                        csv.reader(lines, quotechar='"', delimiter=',',
                            quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL, skipinitialspace=True):
                    No luck.
                    Copy to junk.csv and remove most lines. It works. I don't
                    know which line is giving it trouble. Continue for now.
                :   I really want to use csv.DictReader().
                :   If I want to read in energy as a numeric, I might
                    have to switch the Pandas method.
                    But I don't have Pandas. Better get it.
                        https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started
                            /install.html
                    But this says,
                        For users that are new to Python, the easiest way to
                        install Python, pandas, and the packages that make up
                        the PyData stack (SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more) is
                        with Anaconda, a cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
                        Python distribution for data analytics and scientific
                        computing. Installation instructions for Anaconda can be
                        found here.
                    It looks like getting Pandas is going to complicated and
                    require decisions. Perhaps, for now, I should convert the
                    energy string to a float:
                        >>> float(row['energy'])
                            1.0
                :   The offending title is
                        Del’s Bells
                    The apostrophe is a special character. Replace them in
                    music_performance_repertoire files with the single
                    quote, "'".
                :   I now have a list of dictionaries:
                        >>> len(songs)
                        83
                        >>> songs[79]['title']
                        'The Power Of Love'
                        >>> songs[79]['energy']
                        8.0
                        >>> songs[79]['data']
                        {'artist': 'Huey Lewis',
                         'energy': '8',
                         'genre': 'classic hits',
                         'guitar': '618e',
                         'song': 'The Power Of Love',
                         'technique': 'strum',
                         'type': 'loop w FX',
                         'unplugged': 'yes'}
        -   Now I can import songlist.txt, which contains some misspelled
            titles, and get the corresponding songs.
            >   Start with one: 'Addisonls Walk'
            >   Expand. scratch.py now has a snippet that reads in the
                repertwaar as well as songlist.txt, loops through songlist,
                matches with titles in repertwaar, and prints the best score
                and the next-best score:
                    partial_match_title_a.png
                All matching scores are 70%, and all next-best scores are
                zero.  But does zero make sense? I am only testing for the
                occurrence of two characters.
                    >>> match_score('Time After Time', 'Time In A Bottle')
                        35.714285714285715
                Some nonzero LastScore values should occur.
                Oops, found the bug. Try again:
                    partial_match_title_b.png
                The best false match is 57.1% (for The Wind & The Wheat),
                and the worst true match is 78.6% for Addison's Walk.
                But is it really right? I had better capture the false-match
                song.
                    partial_match_title_c.png
                OK, now I can see that all of the matches are correct even
                though some false matches score pretty high.
                Is that important? I can cut the search off if I find a
                score exceeding a threshold of, say, 70%. Or I can let it find
                the best. The number of iterations is the number of songs
                played in a gig times the number in the repertoire.
                I don't see this exceeding about 50*100 = 5,000. No big deal.
                Find the best.

    *   Back to reverse_songlist.py: Get it to use the Repertwaar for
        correct spellings.
        -   Prototype in scratch.py.
        -   Port code to reverse_songlist.py
            IT WORKS!!
        -   Commit & push

    *   Another easy tool: Reorder the Repertwaar based on last gig:
        move songs from last gig (songlist.txt) to bottom of the Repertwaar to
        create a prioritized list that deprioritizes most recently played at a
        given venue.
        -   I actually used a Lambda function!!
            The Repertwaar is a list with the sort() method that accepts
            a sorting key.
            sort the Repertwaar by title:
                repertwaar.sort( key = lambda s: s['title'] )
            where s is a song within repertwaar. But it is a dictionary,
            so extract the title to use as a sorting key.
            This approach could be used to sort the Repertwaar
            on ANY field:
                repertwaar.sort( key = lambda s: s['energy'] )
            or,
                repertwaar.sort( key = lambda s: s['data']['genre'] )

    *   Calculate the Gig Energy Index as the RMS of the song energies.
        -   It works.
        -   Add it to reverse_songlist.py to get it for every future
            gig.
            >   Some notable gig energies:
